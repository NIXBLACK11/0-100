# Turbo Repo

- Orchastrates the buil of the common frontend backend.
- Also cache the build to fasten the build the next time.

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```

```bash
cd packages/ui
npm run generate:component
```

- you can add frontend easily by going in the app folder and initializing a react/next/angular project
- similarly you can add a backend in the same app folder

also good practice on the tsconfig and see example from the turbo repo documentation
